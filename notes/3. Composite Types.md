## Arrays

- All elements in an array must be of the type that's specified.
```go
var x [3]int // creates an array of integers with size 3 with zero values
var x = [3]int{10, 20, 30} //Use an array literal to specify elements in an array
```

- If you have an array with mostly zeros (sparse array), you can specify the indices with non-zero values:
```go
// [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 100, 15]
var x = [12]int{1, 5: 4, 6, 10: 100, 15}
```

- If you use an array literal, you can replace the size of the array with `...`
```go
var x = [...]int{10, 20, 30} // size 3
```

- You can compare arrays with `==` and `!=`. Arrays are equal if they have the same length and elements.
- You can declare arrays of arrays
```go
var x [2][3]int
```

- You can use `len()` to get the length of an array.
- Arrays are rarely directly used in Go because they have limitations
	- The size of the array is part of its type. 
	- Since types are resolved at compile time, you cannot use variables to specify the size of the array.
	- You can't write functions that work with arrays of any size.
	- You can't assign arrays of different sizes to the same variable.
	- You can't do type conversions between arrays of different sizes.
- Don't use arrays unless you know the exact length of the array ahead of time.

## Slices
- Create a slice by not specifying the size:
```go
var x = []int{10, 20, 30}
```
- All of the different ways to create arrays, apply to slices, just don't specify the size.
- The zero value of a slice is `nil`
```go
var x []int // nil
```

- There are non-nil slices with zero-length using an empty slice literal. This is a bit confusing. Prefer nil slices over this.
```go
var x = []int{}
```

### Comparing slices
- You cannot compare slices with equality operators. You can only compare it with `nil`
- Since Go 1.21, the `slices` package provides two functions to compare slices.
	- `slices.Equal` takes 2 slices and returns `true` if they have the same length and the elements are comparable and equal.
	- `slices.EqualFunc` also takes a function to determine the equality.

### append
- Built-in function to grow slices
- Takes at least two parameters, the slice and a value.
- Returns a slice of the same type
```go
var x []int
x = append(x, 10)

x = append(x, 5, 6, 7) // Append more than 1 value
```

- Use `...` to expand the elements of an array.
```go
y := [int]{5, 6, 7}
x = append(x, y...) // ... expands the values of y
```

- You need to assign the returned value (you get an error if you don't), since it returns a copy of the passed slice with the new element.

### Capacity
- Every slice has a capacity.
- Number of consecutive memory locations reserved.
- This can be larger than the length
- If there is not enough capacity to add an element, the Go runtime allocates a new backing array for the slice with more capacity.

>[!info] The Go Runtime
>The Go runtime provides services like memory allocation, garbage collection, concurrency, networking, the implementations for built-in types and functions.
>
>The runtime is compiled into every Go binary. This makes the binary easier to distribute but even the smallest Go program is about 2MB.

- Memory allocation, data copying and cleaning the old memory takes time.
- The Go runtime allocates more memory than just 1 extra space.
	- "The rule as of Go 1.18 is to double the capacity of a slice when the current capacity is less than 256. A bigger slice increases by `(current_capacity + 768)/4`. This slowly converges at 25% growth (a slice with capacity of 512 will grow by 63%, but a slice with capacity 4,096 will grow by only 30%)."

- Use the built-in function `cap` to check the capacity. This function is rarely used.  `len` is more popular.

### make
- Built-in function that allows you to create an empty slice with length and capacity specified.
```go
x := make([]int, 5) // create a slice of int with len 5 and cap 5
```

- A common mistake is to use `append` with a new slice using `make`. 
```go
x := make([]int, 5)
x = append(x, 10) // This would put the 10 at index 5.
```

- Specify the initial capacity:
```go
x := make([]int, 5, 10) // len 5, cap 10
```

- Create a slice with zero length but some capacity:
```go
x := make([]int, 0, 10)
x = append(x, 4, 5, 6) // [4, 5, 6] len 3, cap 10
```

### clear
- Go 1.21 added a `clear` function.
- Takes in a slice and sets all elements to the zero value. The length is unchanged.

### Which declare option should you use?

- The goal is to reduce the amount of times a slice needs to grow. 

**Situations**:
- If it's posible that the slice may not need to grow, you can use a nil slice.

- If you have starting values, or the values wont change, a slice literal is a good choice.

- If you have an idea of how large the slice needs to be but don't know the values yet, use `make`. Should you specify some length or a zero-length and some capacity? Cases:
	1. If you need a buffer, specify some length.
	2. If you are *sure* about the size that you want, you can specify some length and use the index to set the values. This may lead to some errors like range errors.
	3. Use a zero length and some capacity, use `append` to add values.

- There is some debate between cases 2 and 3. (Personally 3 seems good).

### Slicing slices
- You can slice slices with the slice expression `x[a:b]` .
```go
x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
y := x[:2] // ["a", "b"]
z := x[1:] // ["b", "c", "d"]
```

- Slices share memory
```go
x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
y := x[:2] // ["a", "b"]
y[0] = "x"
fmt.Println("x:", x) // ["a", "x", "c", "d"]
```

- Memory sharing between slices can get more confusing when using `append`:
```go
x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
y := x[:2] // ["a", "b"]
fmt.Println(cap(x), cap(y)) // same capacity
y = append(y, "z") // "z" overwrites the "c" in x
fmt.Println("x:", x) // ["a", "b", "z", "d"]
fmt.Println("y:", y) // ["a", "b", "z"]
```

- To avoid confusion, avoid using `append` when working with subslices, or use *full slice expressions*.
- A full slice expression includes a third element that indicates the last position (exclusive) to be available as capacity to the subslice.
```go
x := make([]string, 0, 5)
x = append(x, "a", "b", "c", "d")
z := x[2:4:4] // Subslice with capacity 4-2=2
z = append(z, "y") // Allocates new memory, avoiding the memory sharing.
```

### copy
- `copy` copies the elements from one slice into another one. The first argument is the destination, the second argument is the source.
```go
x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
y := make([]int, 2, 4) // len 2, cap 4
num := copy(y, x)
fmt.Println(y, num) // [1 2] 2
```
- `copy` tries to copy as many values as it can, limited by the length of the slices.
- You can use subslices with copy:
```go
x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
num := copy(x[:3], x[1:])
fmt.Println(x, num) //[2 3 4 4] 3
```

### Converting Arrays to Slices
- You can take slices from arrays using the same slice expression.
```go
xArray := [4]int{5, 6, 7, 8}
xSlice := xArray[:] // Converts the entire array into a slice
```
- This has the same memory sharing properties as taking a slice from a slice.

### Converting Slices to Arrays
- Use type conversion:
```go
xSlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
xArray := [4]int(xSlice) // Copies all elements
smallArray := [2]int(xSlice) // Copies the first 2 elements
```
- This creates a new memory allocation. 
- You cannot use `[...]`, you must specify the size.
- The slice cannot be smaller than the array.

## Strings, Runes and Bytes

- Go strings are a sequence of bytes, not runes.
- The bytes don't need to be in a particular character encoding but many Go library functions assume that a string is a sequence of UTF-8 encoded code points.

>[!note] Go source code is always written in UTF-8

- You can index a string.
```go
var s string = "Hello there"
var b byte = s[6]
```

- Slice expressions work with strings.
```go
var s string = "Hello there"
var s2 string = s[4:7] // "o t"
```

-  Code points may be multiple bytes long in UTF-8. The `len` function will count the amount of bytes.
```go
// The globe is 4 bytes long
s := "Hello 🌎"
s2 := s[4:7]
s3 := s[6:]

fmt.Printf("s: %v, len: %d\n", s, len(s)) // s: Hello 🌎, len: 10
fmt.Printf("s2: %v, len: %d\n", s2, len(s2)) // s2: o �, len: 3
fmt.Printf("s3: %v, len: %d\n", s3, len(s3)) // s3: 🌎, len: 4
```

- Runes and bytes can be converted to a string
```go
var a rune    = 'x'
var s string  = string(a)
var b byte    = 'y'
var s2 string = string(b)
```

>[!warning] Don't cast `int` to `string`
>Casting an int into a string does not convert the individual digits to a string.
>```go
>var x int = 65
var y = string(x) // The result is "A", not "65"
>```

- You can cast a string into a slice of bytes or a slice of runes.
```go
var s string = "Hello, "
var bs []byte = []byte(s) // [72 101 108 108 111 32 240 159 140 142]
var rs []rune = []rune(s) // [72 101 108 108 111 32 127758]
```

- Slices of bytes are more common than slices of runes.

>[!info] UTF-8 #UTF-8
>UTF-8 is the most common encoding for Unicode. Unicode uses four bytes (32 bits) to represent a code point (technical name for a character and modifier).
>
>The easiest way to store unicode is to store four bytes for each code point (UTF-32), but it uses too much space.
>
>UTF-16 is more common. It uses one or two bytes to represent a code point, but most of the content can fit into a single byte.
>
>UTF-8 uses from a single byte, up to 4 bytes to store the larger Unicode code points. Worst case, UTF-8 is the same a UTF-32. A downside is that cannot randomly access a string encoded with UTF-8. You can detect if you are in the middle of a character, but you can't tell how many characters in you are. You need to start at the beginning of the string, and count.

- Use the functions in the `strings` and `unicode/utf8` packages to extract substrings and code points from strings, instead of slices and indexes.

## Maps
- Maps are used for storing collections of (key, value) pairs. Maps in Go are implemented as hash maps. Watch [GopherCon 2016: Inside the Map Implementation](https://youtu.be/Tl7mi9QmLns?si=z1mN3Bbb2OVCq4oj) to learn more.
- The zero value of a map is nil.
```go
// Create a map with zero value
var nilMap map[string]int // a map with string keys and int values
```

- You can create an empty map, using a map literal.
```go
emptyMap := map[string]int{}
```

- Or you can add initial values to the map:
```go
teams := map[string][]string {
    "Orcas": []string{"Fred", "Ralph", "Bijou"},
    "Lions": []string{"Sarah", "Peter", "Billie"},
    "Kittens": []string{"Waldo", "Raul", "Ze"},
}
```

- You can create maps with `make` with an optional size. The size is used as a hint to approximate how much memory to allocate, but the map itself does not have a specified capacity, and the length will be 0.
```go
m := make(map[int]int, 10) // Approximate size 10
```
- Maps are only comparable to `nil`
- The key for a map can be any comparable type.

### Read and Store data in a map
- Reading and writing values works very similarly to other languages.
```go
ages := map[string]int{}
ages["Juan"] = 25
fmt.Println(ages["Juan"]) // 25
```

- Reading a value that was never set, returns the zero value of the value type.
```go
fmt.Println(ages["Maria"]) // no value for "Maria", returns 0
ages["Maria"]++
fmt.Println(ages["Maria"]) // 1
```

### The comma ok Idiom
- The *comma ok idiom* is used in Go when you want to differentiate between reading a value and getting back the zero value.
- To differentiate map values that have a set value vs a zero value, you can use the "comma ok idiom".
```go
v, ok := ages["Ryan"] // 0, false
```

### Delete and Clear
- Works as you would imagine.
- `delete(map, key)` to delete a key-value pair.
- `clear(map)` to clear a map. This sets the length to 0.

### Comparing maps
- Go 1.21 added the `maps` package.
- You can use `maps.Equal` and `maps.EqualFunc`, similar to the slices function in [[#Comparing slices]].
```go
m := map[string]int{
    "hello": 5,
    "world": 10,
}
n := map[string]int{
    "world": 10,
    "hello": 5,
}
fmt.Println(maps.Equal(m, n)) // prints true
```

### Maps as Sets
- You can use a `map[key]bool` map to replicate the functionality of set in Go. Since the zero value of `bool` is  `false`, any key that's not in the map will return false.

- For operations like union, intersection and substraction, implement your own or look for a third party library.

## Structs
- Use structs for making groups of related data.

>[!info] Go does not have classes
>Go does not have classes, because there is no inheritance.
>The language has some features similar to object-oriented languages.

- Define a struct using the `type` keyword:
```go
type book struct {
	title  string
	pages  int
	author string
}
```

- You can define structs inside or outside of a function. A struct defined inside a function only exists within that function.

- You can create zero value structs by assigning no value. A zero value struct has every attribute/field assigned the it's zero value.
```go
var learningGo book // {"", 0, ""}
```

- Using an empty struct literal work the same as assigning no value.
```go
learningGo := book{} // {"", 0, ""}
```

- Create structs by passing a struct literal with a list of values. You need to pass a value for all fields with this format.
```go
learningGo := book{"Learning Go", 494, "Jon Bodner"}
```

- Or create structs using a map-like struct literal. You don't to pass a value for all fields, and they don't need to be in order.
```go
learningGo := book{title: "Learning Go", author: "Jon Bodner"}
```

>[!tip] Use list-like for small structs, map-like for bigger structs
>The list-like struct literals for small structs is fine for a few fields.
>Prefer the map-like literals for bigger structs or optional fields, it's clearer and more maintainable. 

- Use dot syntax to read and write fields from a struct
```go
learningGo.pages = 200
fmt.Println(learningGo.pages)
```

### Anonymous Structs

- You can declare variables with a nameless struct, called an anonymous struct.
```go
phone := struct {
	brand string
	color string
}{
	brand: "samsung",
	color: "blue",
}
```

- These are useful for unmarshaling (JSON to struct) and marshaling (struct to JSON) data. It's also used in tests.

### Comparing and Converting

- Structs with only comparable fields, are comparable. (Slices, maps, channels, etc are not comparable).
- To compare structs with uncomparable fields, you can write your own function.

>[!info] You can't redefine `==` and `!=` to work for incomparable structs.

- You can't compare two variables if they have different non-anonymous struct types.
- You can compare two structs if one or both structs are anonymous and have exactly the same fields. Same names, order and types of field.
- You can do type conversion between structs if the fields are exactly the same. Same names, order and types.
