## Blocks
- You can declare variables in multiple places in Go. Each of these places is called a *block*.
- Declarations outside of any function are in the *package block*.
- `import` statements define names for other packages. These names are in the *file block*.
- Variables defined at the top level of a function (including function parameters) are inside a block. 
- Within a function, every set of braces `{}` define another block. 
- Control structures define blocks.
- You can access identifiers from outer blocks, inside inner blocks.
- Built-in types, constants (`true`, `false`), built-in functions (`make`, `close`) and `nil` are in the *universe block*.

## Shadowing variables
- If you declare something in a block, with the same name as something from an outside block, you *shadow* the outer identifier.
- A shadowing variable is a variable that has the same name as a variable from an outer block. While the shadowing variable exists, the shadowed variable is inaccessible. 


## If statements
- Similar to many other languages
- Go allows you to define variables that only exist in the if-else scope. In the next example, `n` only exists in the conditional branches. After that, `n` is undefined.
```go
if n := rand.Intn(10); n == 0 {
    fmt.Println("That's too low")
} else if n > 5 {
    fmt.Println("That's too big:", n)
} else {
    fmt.Println("That's a good number:", n)
}
```

## For statements
- `for` is the only loop in Go, but it has four formats:

1. Classic C-Style. It is more customizable, you can leave out parts.
```go
// C-style
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

// You can leave out one or more parts of the `for`
i := 0
for ; i < 10; i++ {
	//...
}

for i := 0; i < 10; {
	//...
	i += 2
}
```

2. The condition-only, while style 
```go
i := 1
for i < 100 {
	fmt.Println(i)
	i *= 2
}
```

3. Infinite for loop.
```go
for {
	fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

1. for-range is used for iterating over elements in built-in types and user-defined types based on them. The values are a copy of the element.
```go
numbers := []int{11, 15, 20, 24, 40, 64}
for i, v := range numbers {
	fmt.Println(i, v)
}

// You can ignore the indexes using an underscore
for _, v := range numbers {
	fmt.Println(i, v)
}

// Or you can ignore the value
for i := range numbers {
	fmt.Println(i, v)
}

```

- Iterating over maps is performed in random order.
- A string is iterated over its runes, not bytes. This can lead to interesting behavior. Notice in the example below that index 7 is skipped, since π takes 2 bytes.
```go
for i, r := range "apple_π!" {
	fmt.Println(i, r, string(r))
}
// Prints:
// 0 97 a
// 1 112 p
// 2 112 p
// 3 108 l
// 4 101 e
// 5 95 _
// 6 960 π
// 8 33 !
```

### Break and Continue
- You can use `break` and `continue` as usual.
- You can add labels to specify where to continue/break to. The label is indented to the level of the block.
```go
func main() {
	words := []string{"potato", "rendezvous"}
outer:
	for _, word := range words {
		for i, r := range word {
			if r == 'z' {
				fmt.Println("Found z at index", i)
				break outer
			}
		}
		fmt.Println("No z in", word)
	}
}
```
## Switch
- Similar to other languages with a few upgrades.
- You can declare variables thats scoped to the switch cases.
```go
words := []string{"bird", "potato", "monitor", "motherboard"}
for _, word := range words {
	switch size := len(word); size {
	case 1, 2, 3, 4:
		fmt.Println(word, "is short")
	case 5, 6:
		fmt.Println(word, "is nice")
	case 7, 8: //do nothing with this cases
	default:
		fmt.Println(word, "is long")
	}
}
```

- Each case has it's own block.
- No need to add `break` to each case.
- There is a `fallthrough` keyword that allows you to continue to the next case. Avoid using this.
- If you want to break out of a loop while inside a case, you can use a label.

### Blank switch statements
- If you don't specify the value that you are comparing against, you get a *blank switch*.
- This type of switch allows you to write boolean comparisons for each case.
```go
words := []string{"bird", "potato", "monitor", "motherboard"}
for _, word := range words {
	switch size := len(word); {
	case size <= 4:
		fmt.Println(word, "is short")
	case size == 5 || size == 6:
		fmt.Println(word, "is nice")
	case size == 7 || size == 8: //do nothing with this cases
	default:
		fmt.Println(word, "is long")
	}
}
```

- If you are checking equality, prefer the usual switch statement.

### If or Switch?
- Functionally, a blank switch and a series of if-else statements do the same.
- A switch statement implies a relationship between the values or comparisons, like making differents comparisons with the same variable.
- If-else is more general.

## Goto
- `goto` in Go is implemented with some restrictions.
- Go forbids:
	- Jumps that skip over variable declarations
	- Jumps that go into an inner or parallel block

- For example, here are two illegal jumps:
```go
func main() {
    a := 10
    goto skip // Illegal: jumps over the declaration of `b`
    b := 20
skip:
    c := 30
    fmt.Println(a, b, c)
    if c > a {
        goto inner // Illegal: jumps to a different block in the same level
    }
    if a < b {
    inner: 
        fmt.Println("a is less than b")
    }
}
```

- You should still avoid using `goto`. You can break out of complex flows using labels with `break` and `continue`.
- There are some valid cases where `goto` is useful. To get the same logic in the following example without `goto`, you would would need to use a flag variable and break out the loop. 
```go
func main() {
    a := rand.Intn(10)
    for a < 100 {
        if a%5 == 0 {
            goto done
        }
        a = a*2 + 1
    }
    fmt.Println("do something when the loop completes normally")
done:
    fmt.Println("do stuff no matter why we left the loop")
    fmt.Println(a)
}
```
