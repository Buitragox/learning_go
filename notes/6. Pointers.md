## Introduction

- Variables are stored in one or more contiguous memory locations (addresses).
- A pointer is a variable that holds the location in memory (address) where a value is stored.
- The zero value for a pointer is `nil`.
```go
var pointerZ *string // nil value
var x int = 10
var y bool = true
pointerX := &x
pointerY := &y
```
- Pointers usually take up 8 bytes (64 bits) of memory. Depends on the platform.
- Slices, maps, functions, channels and interfaces are implemented with pointers (that's why their zero value is `nil`).
- `nil` is an untyped identifier (in the universe block) that represents a lack of value.
- Pointer arithmetic is not allowed in Go.
## Operators
- `&` is the address operator. It goes before a variable and returns the address of that value.
```go
x := 10
pointerToX := &x
```

- `*` is the indirection operator. It goes before a pointer variable and returns the value it points to (dereferencing).
```go
z := 5 + *pointerToX // 5 + 10
```

- Dereferencing a `nil` pointers makes the program panic. You must make sure that the pointer is not `nil`.
```go
var x *int
fmt.Println(x == nil) // prints true
fmt.Println(*x)       // panics
```

## Pointer types
- The built-in function `new` creates a pointer variable. It returns a pointer to a zero-value instance of the passed type.
```go
var pointerToX *int = new(int)
```

- `new` is rarely used.
- You can create a pointer from a struct literal. `x := &Foo{}`

- You can't get the address of primitive literals (numbers, string, booleans) or constants. You need to assign the value to a variable first. Sometimes, this is inconvenient:
```go
type person struct {
	Name *string
}

p := person{
  FirstName:  &"Pat", // This won't compile.
}
```
- There are two solutions, assign "Pat" to a variable and get the address of the variable, or create a generic helper function that takes any parameter and returns a pointer to it:
```go
// Solution #1
pat := "Pat"
p := person{
  FirstName:  &pat,
}

// Solution #2
func makePointer[T any](t T) *T {
	return &t
}

p := person{
  FirstName:  makePointer("Pat"),
}
```

## Mutable Parameters

- Go constants give names for literal expressions that can be calculated at compile time. Go has no mechanism to declare that other values are immutable.
- Immutability is usually preferred because it's safer and easier to understand.
- Since Go is call-by-value, values passed to functions are copies. For non-pointer types, this means that the original value is safe from being modified by a function.
- Go devs use pointers to indicate mutable parameters. 
```go
// This changes the pointer, not the value it points to.
// This does not change the original value
func failedUpdate(px *int) { 
    x2 := 20
    px = &x2 
}

// Change the value its pointed to.
func update(px *int) {
    *px = 20
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    failedUpdate(&x)
    fmt.Println(x) // prints the original 10
    update(&x)
    fmt.Println(x) // prints 20
}
```

## Pointers are Last Resort

- Mutability can make it harder to understand the data flow and make more work for the garbage collector.
- For example, instead of creating a function that changes a struct by passing a pointer, make a function that creates and returns the struct.

```go
// DONT do this
func MakeFoo(f *Foo) error {
	f.Field1 = "val"
	f.Field2 = 20
	return nil
}

// DO this instead
func MakeFoo() (Foo, error) {
	f := Foo{
		Field1: "val",
		Field2: 20
	}
	return f, nil
}
```

- The only time you should use pointer parameters to modify a variable is when the function expects an interface.
- When returning values from a function, prefer value types.
- Unmarshaling (JSON to struct) is one case where pointers are used, because it predates generics in Go and for performance reasons. While unmarshaling is common in Go, this is the exception, not the rule.

## Performance of pointers
- The time to pass a pointer to a function is the same in all cases.
- In the majority of cases, there is little difference between passing parameters by value, or passing a pointer.
- If the size of the data is large, using pointers could improve performance.
- Returning a pointer value could be better or worse depending on the platform.

## Zero-Value vs No Value
- Go pointers are commonly used to differentiate between zero value and no value since `nil` can be assigned to a pointer.
- But pointers also indicate mutability, so exercise caution when using this pattern.
- For example, instead of returning `nil` from a function, use the [[3. Composite Types#The comma ok Idiom|comma ok idiom]] used in maps and return a value and a boolean.
- In general, unless you intend to modify the original value, resist the temptation to use a pointer field to indicate no value and use "comma ok", 

## Difference between Maps and Slices

### Maps
- Maps are implemented as a pointer to a struct. Passing a map to a function means creating a copy of the pointer. 
- You can add as many things as you want to the map and the pointer remains the same.
- Be careful when using maps as input parameters or return values, especially of public APIs. On a API-design level, maps are usually a bad choice because the have no restraint or specification over what keys the contain.
- Prefer using structs instead of maps, unless you don't know the fields at compile time.

### Slices
- Slices are structs with 3 fields. A pointer to the block of memory, an `int` length and `int` capacity.
![[slice_struct.png]]

- Passing a slice to a function means copying the pointer, length and capacity.
- The copy can modify the contents of the block of memory of the original slice. For example it could modify the elements from 0 to `length`, and the original slice can see the changes.
- However, when using `append` (and there is enough capacity in the backing array), the length of copy changes, while the length of the original stays the same. So the original slice does not see the changes.
- If `append` is used, and there is not enough capacity, a new backing array is created, so the copy no longer has access to the original block of memory.

- Slices are frequently passed around in Go. By default, you should assume that functions do not modify slices. A functions documentation should specify wether it modifies a slice's contents.

## Slices as Buffers
- When working with resources, like files or networks, you are usually reading chunks of data, one at a time. 
- Instead of creating a new slice for each chunk of data, use the same slice as a buffer to read data from the source. This what functions like `file.Read` do.

## Reducing the Garbage Collector's Workload
- Garbage refers to "data that has no more pointers pointing to it". Unused data occupies memory that can be reused.
- The garbage collector detects unused memory and recovers it so it can be reused.
- Garbage still needs to be cleaned up, so it's good to reduce the amount of garbage.
### Stack
- The stack is a consecutive block of memory. Allocating memory of the stack is fast and simple: 
	1. A *stack pointer* tracks the last location where memory was allocated. Allocating memory means changing the value of the stack pointer.
	2. When a function is called, a new *stack frame* is created for that function's data. 
	3. Parameters and local variables are stored in the stack. Variables move the stack pointer by the size of the type.
	4. When a function exists, the return values are copied to the calling function. 
	5. The stack pointer is moved back to the beginning of the stack frame for the exited function. This deallocates all stack memory used by the called function.
- This is a simplified version of how the stack works, in reality there are more nuances and details, like registers. But the general concept still applies.

- To store something in the stack, you need to know the size of the data. In [[3. Composite Types#Arrays]], it was mentioned that the size of an array is part of its type. That is because arrays are stored in the stack.
- In Go, each goroutine has its own stack which can grow and shrink. The runtime manages each goroutine.

#### Pointers and the stack
- Pointers can point to data on the stack, but some conditions must be met:
	1. The data must be a local variable with known size at compile time. If you don't know the size, memory can't be allocated by moving the stack pointer.
	2. The pointer cannot be returned from the function. If this happens, the local data would no longer be valid when the stack pointer is moved back.
	3. If the pointer is passed to a function, the conditions must still hold.

When the compiler determines that data can't be stored on the stack, the data the pointer points to "escapes" the stack, and the compiler stores it on the *heap*.
### Heap
- The heap is memory managed by the garbage collector. (In C or C++, by hand).
- Data stored on the heap is valid as long as there are pointers on the stack that point to it.
- Once no pointers point to data on the heap, it becomes garbage that needs to be cleaned up.
- The *escape analysis* done by the Go compiler is not perfect. Sometimes it escapes data to the heap that could have been stored in the stack, but it won't risk memory corruptions.
- Storing data in the heap creates a couple of problems related to performance:
	1. The garbage collector takes time to work. This is time that the program could spend working. 
	2. Finding the data that pointers point to in RAM is slower than reading data sequentially.

 >[!note] Low Latency over Higher Throughput
 >The Go garbage collector favors low latency over higher throughput, which means that Go prefers to scan for garbage as quickly as possible rather than trying to find the most garbage in one scan. Each garbage-collection cycle is designed to “stop the world” (pause the program) for fewer than 500 microseconds.

- Writing software that's aware of the hardware is called *mechanical sympathy*. From the world of car racing, it means that a driver who understands their car can squeeze out every drop of performance out of it.

- Go encourages to use pointers sparingly. This way you reduce the load on the GC.
## Tuning the Garbage Collector
 - The GB doesn't immediately reclaim memory as soon as there is garbage, that would impact performance. It lets garbage to pile up for a while.
 - There are a couple of settings available to control the size of the heap.

### GOGC
 - The `GOGC` environment variable: the formula `CURRENT_HEAP_SIZE + CURRENT_HEAP_SIZE*GOGC/100` determines the heap size that needs to be reached to trigger the next garbage collection cycle. This is a simplified formula.
 - `GOGC` is set to 100 by default, which means that when the heap size is doubled, the next GC cycle is triggered.
 - Rough estimate: doubling the `GOGC` halves the CPU time spent on GC.
 - Setting `GOGC` to `off` disables the GC.
### GOMEMLIMIT
 - `GOMEMLIMIT` sets a soft limit on the total amount of memory the Go program is allowed to use. 
 - This setting is set to `math.MaxInt64` by default. It is unlikely that a computer has that much memory, so it's considered to be "disabled". 
 - The value for `GOMEMLIMIT` is specified in bytes, but you can optionally use the suffixes B, KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB. For example, `GOMEMLIMIT=3GiB`.
 - You can combine `GOMEMLIMIT` with `GOGC` to tune how much memory the program should use and how often it should be collected.
